**[Engagement Type]** | [Key Metric]
[2-3 sentence description of what you did and the outcome.]

> "[Client quote if available]" — [Name], [Title]

**Tags:** [industry], [engagement-type], [company-size]
```

## Your Case Studies

<!-- Add your case studies below. The /scope-proposal skill will pick the most relevant ones based on the client's industry and needs. -->

### [Example Client] — [Industry]
**[What you did]** | [Result]
[Description of the engagement and outcomes.]

**Tags:** [tag1], [tag2], [tag3]

*Add at least 2-3 case studies for proposals to work well. More is better — the system picks the most relevant ones automatically.*
